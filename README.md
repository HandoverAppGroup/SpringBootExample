# SpringBootExample

- Open in IntelliJ
- Alter src/main/resources/application.properties to reflect your own database setup (database url, username, password etc.)
- Run the bootRun application gradle task to run the api - you should then be able to post and get tasks and localhost:8080/api/tasks
- Run the test verification gradle task to run tests - this will also automatically produce example code snippets in target/snippets for documentation purposes
